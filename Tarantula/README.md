# Printing with Tevo Tarantula (2017)
This was the first attempt to in PETG. Some tinkering was needed to make it work. Here I'll share my gcode and and my Ultimaker Cura Profile for PETG on the Tevo Tarantula.

## Prerequisites
1. I'm using a glass print bed covered with glue stick. The glass influences the print bed temperature. This is why I print with 90â„ƒ. If you do not have a glass print bed, the temperature might have to be adjusted.
2. I upgraded to a cooling fan. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2186095

## Filament
I'm using esum PETG in orange (EAN 6 922572 264083) and solid black (EAN 6 922572 264083).

Notice: I'm not done yet, printing all the parts. And I have not assembled the printer yet. I'll keep this repo up do date.
